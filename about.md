Hello! I've just graduated from Dartmouth College with an MA degree in Comparative Literature. I enjoy learning about new software and using my writing skills to create useful and clear documentation for different audiences. In my previous role as a technical writer, I gained experience in creating user manuals and video tutorials in collaboration with development teams.

This website has a few examples of my work. I am actively looking for opportunities in technical writing. Please donâ€™t hesitate to contact me at ttvatansever (at) gmail (dot) com.

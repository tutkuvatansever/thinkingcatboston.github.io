A user guide for the iOS application Flora. I created this guide in Oxygen XML Editor following the Google Style Guide. Working on this guide, I had a chance to practice writing clear and concise instructions and structuring information using main DITA XML elements. You can view the DITA Map of the project, the PDF and HTML5 files in my [Flora user guide repository](https://github.com/tutkuvatansever/Flora-user-guide){:target="_blank"}.

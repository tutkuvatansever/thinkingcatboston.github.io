PixelBuddy is a project in progress. It's a color by number pixel art game that we created with friends. Identifying customer needs and product objectives, I also created documentation to support developers. I created the artwork and the animations featured in the app. You can view the PDF of the product requirements document that I wrote in my [PixelBuddy repository](https://github.com/tutkuvatansever/PixelBuddy){:target="_blank"}.

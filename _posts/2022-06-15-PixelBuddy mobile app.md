PixelBuddy is a project in progress. It's a color by number pixel art game that we created with friends. Identifying customer needs and product objectives, I created documentation to support developers. I also created the artwork and the animations featured in the app. You can view [the PDF of the product requirements document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rj_AWaty77vsOUoF1aMRuFuMe_83dtO637YIDS6LFHA/preview){:target="_blank"} that I wrote.

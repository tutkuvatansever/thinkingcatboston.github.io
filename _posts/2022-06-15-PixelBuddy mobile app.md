PixelBuddy is a project in progress. It's a color by number pixel art game that I created with friends. It I came up with the idea for this app and created the artwork and the animations. I've conducted extensive market research, identified customer needs and product objectives and then wrote documentation to support developers. You can view the PDF of the product requirements document that I created in my [PixelBuddy repository](https://thinkingcatboston.com/){:target="_blank"}.
